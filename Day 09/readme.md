Decision Tree Regression
This project demonstrates Decision Tree Regression in Python using scikit-learn.

Overview
A Decision Tree Regressor predicts a continuous target variable by learning simple decision rules from the data.
In this example, we train a model to predict salaries based on position levels.

Steps in the Code
1. Import Libraries – numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.

2. Load Dataset – Read the CSV file containing position levels and salaries.

3. Train Model – Fit a DecisionTreeRegressor to the data.

4. Make Predictions – Predict salary for a given position level.

4. Visualize – Plot the decision tree predictions vs. actual data.
