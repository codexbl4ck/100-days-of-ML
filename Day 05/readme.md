## Day 5 - Multiple Linear regression with Model Evaluation

Today I learned about **Multiple Linear regression**, where we pridict a target with **More than one feature** and also we learned to evaluate our model, to check how accurate our model is.

### What I did:
- Created a sample dataset with `Experience`, `Age`, and `Education Level`
- Trained a `LinearRegression` model using `scikit-learn`
- Predicted salary based on all three inputs
- Check accuracy of our model using Mean Square Error and R2 score

### What I learned:
- Multiple features improve prediction accuracy
- Real-world problems require multiple inputs, not just one
- Using evaluation techniques to check that if our model is pridicting true values
- Always use clean data for training to avoid any conflict
