# Day 10 â€“ Random Forest Classifier ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³ðŸŒ³
Goal: Learn and implement Random Forest to classify flowers from the Iris dataset.

## What I did today

â€¢ Loaded the Iris dataset (built into scikit-learn).

â€¢ Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

â€¢ Created a RandomForestClassifier with 100 decision trees.

â€¢ Trained the model and checked accuracy.

â€¢ Predicted the species of a new flower.

## Key Notes

â€¢ Random Forest = Many Decision Trees working together (majority vote).

â€¢ test_size=0.2 â†’ 20% data for testing.

â€¢ random_state=42 â†’ Makes results repeatable.

â€¢ Very high accuracy because Iris is a simple dataset.

# Example Prediction
For flower:
[5.0, 1.4, 1.7, 0.5] â†’ Predicted species: Setosa âœ…
