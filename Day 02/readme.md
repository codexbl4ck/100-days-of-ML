# 📊 Day 2 – Statistics with Python

This session covers foundational statistical concepts using Python. We practiced:

- **Mean**
- **Median**
- **Mode**
- **Variance**
- **Standard Deviation**
- **Covariance**
- **Correlation**

Each concept is backed by Python code and detailed explanation to lock in the learning!
