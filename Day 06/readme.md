# Day 1 â€“ Machine Learning with Scikit-learn

## What I Did Today

Today, I began my practical journey with Scikit-learn by:

- Importing and understanding the given dataset.
- Cleaning the dataset by:
  - Dropping unnecessary columns (`Unnamed: 0`, `Id`, etc.).
  - Handling categorical features.
- Preprocessing data using both **manual** and **Scikit-learn methods** like `OneHotEncoder`.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Building a basic **Linear Regression** model using `sklearn.linear_model`.
- Training the model and testing predictions.
- Calculating accuracy using `r2_score`.

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

**Progress:** Strong and clear start to ML with `scikit-learn`.  
**Next Up:** Try using other models (like Decision Tree, Random Forest) and improve accuracy.
