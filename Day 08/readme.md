# Day 8 – Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Today I learned about Support Vector Machines (SVM).

SVM is used for **classification** problems.  
It works by finding the best possible boundary (line) that separates different classes of data, while keeping the widest margin possible between them.

For this day’s task, I built a model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on:
- Study Hours
- Sleep Hours

I used a simple dataset and applied a linear kernel SVM.  
The model achieved perfect accuracy on my small test set.

Key takeaway:  
**Linear Regression predicts values, while SVM classifies into categories by drawing the best boundary.**
